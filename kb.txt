DAY-2 RUNBOOK (Example Pillars)
- Reliability: SLO governance, error‑budget policy, platform SRE patterns.
- Cost: FinOps KPIs (unit cost, anomaly MTTR, rightsizing yield).
- Security: AI policy & model‑risk controls, data governance.
- Operations: Tool‑calling agents with human‑in‑the‑loop workflows.
- Adoption: Change‑management, training, and center‑of‑excellence setup.

SUCCESS METRICS (Draft)
- MTTR improvement target: 30–50%
- Cost optimization uplift: 10–20% vs. baseline
- Deployment frequency: +25–40% with guardrails
- Policy conformance: >95% on pre‑prod checks for gated workloads
